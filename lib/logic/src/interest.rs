//! # Entity Replication Radius System, Interest Management
//!
//! This module implements a **multi-tiered interest management** system for the
//! authoritative game server.  Instead of a single flat enter/leave radius, it
//! divides the world around each player into four concentric *replication zones*
//! and drives per-zone check frequencies.
//!
//! ## Zone layout (world units from player)
//!
//! ```text
//!   ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
//!   ║  Zone 3, Background  (0 – 250 wu)   500 ms tick       ║
//!   ║  ╔═══════════════════════════════════╗                ║
//!   ║  ║  Zone 2, Distant  (0 – 150 wu)  160 ms tick        ║
//!   ║  ║  ╔═════════════════════╗          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║ Zone 1, Combat      ║ 50 ms    ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║ (0 – 80 wu)         ║          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║  ╔═══════════╗      ║          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║  ║ Zone 0    ║16ms  ║          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║  ║ Immediate ║      ║          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║  ║ 0–40 wu   ║      ║          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ║  ╚═══════════╝      ║          ║                ║
//!   ║  ║  ╚═════════════════════╝          ║                ║
//!   ║  ╚═══════════════════════════════════╝                ║
//!   ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hysteresis (anti-flicker)
//!
//! Each zone has an **enter radius** and a larger **leave radius**.  An entity
//! enters awareness at the enter radius and only leaves when it crosses the
//! leave radius (enter + 25 wu).  This eliminates the oscillation ("popping")
//! that occurs when a player stands right at a boundary.
//!
//! ## Fast-mover prediction
//!
//! The manager tracks the player's speed via an exponential moving average.
//! When the player moves faster than 20 wu/s the effective query radius is
//! expanded by 40 wu so entities are ghosted-in *before* they would otherwise
//! appear, hiding the latency of the spawn notification.
//!
//! ## Occlusion culling, height-band heuristic
//!
//! `is_occluded` applies a geometry-free occlusion approximation that is
//! correct for the elevation structure of Endfield's maps:
//!
//! | Elevation tier      | Typical Y range (wu) |
//! |---------------------|---------------------|
//! | Ground floor        | 99 – 102            |
//! | Raised structures   | 107 – 115           |
//! | Elevated platforms  | 128 – 132           |
//!
//! When the absolute vertical separation between the observer and an entity
//! exceeds [`HEIGHT_THRESHOLD`] AND the horizontal distance exceeds
//! [`HORIZ_MIN`], terrain is assumed to obstruct line-of-sight.  This catches
//! enemies on a completely different floor without any collision mesh.
//!
//! Results are cached per entity for the duration of one Zone 0 tick
//! (16 ms) inside [`OcclusionCache`], so each entity is evaluated at most
//! once per tick even if the spatial grid returns it in multiple cells.
